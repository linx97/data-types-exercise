		* Why does the following print NaN?
		* How could we fix the following so that it prints 3?

		// It prints NaN because it is trying to add a letter plus a number. Because the letter is Not a Number, it cannot add a + 3 and therefore prints NaN. In order to print 3, you would need to either delete the (a + ) from the variable or change a + 3 to 0 + 3.

		var a;
		a = 3;

		console.log(a);
